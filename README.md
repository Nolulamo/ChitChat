```

Install dependencies from the **requirements.txt** text file

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Backend Server Startup

### Setting Up Docker (Optional)

#### Install Docker on Windows

Download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website: [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) 

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will be running on your system.

#### Install Docker on MacOS

Download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website: [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) 

Double-click the installer package to mount the Docker disk image.

Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

Open Docker from the Applications folder and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will be running on your system.

#### Install Docker on Linux

NB: Refer to the official Docker documentation for updates: [Docker Desktop for Linux (Ubuntu)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Open a terminal window.

Update the package index:

```sh
sudo apt update
```

Install Docker dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

Add the Docker GPG key:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Set up the stable Docker repository:

```sh
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update the package index again:

```sh
sudo apt update
```

Install Docker:

```sh
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Docker should now be installed on your Linux system. Check if Docker is installed correctly:

```sh
docker --version
```

#### Run the application

To run this project using docker, please follow these steps:

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```sh
